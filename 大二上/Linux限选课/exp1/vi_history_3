The vi history
The vi editor was developed at the University of California
Berkeley as part of the Berkeley UNIX system.
At the beginning the vi (visual) editor was part of the ex editor 
and you had to be in the ex editor to use the vi editor.
The vi part of the ex editor was often used and became 
very popular. This popularity forced the creators to come up 
with a separate vi editor.
Now the vi editor is independent of the ex editor and is available 
on most of the UNIX operating systems.
The vi editor is a good, efficient editor for every editing jobs 
although it could be more user friendly.
