Vim is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix.
Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, based it upon the source code for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991. 
Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. 
Vim is free and open-source software and is released under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. 
The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies "under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version".
